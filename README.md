## How CineChase Works

CineChase functions as a media player and organizer only.

To use the app:

1. Open CineChase on your Apple TV  
2. Go to the **Sources** tab  
3. Add a video source URL that you have access to  
4. CineChase reads and organizes the media from that source  
5. Select any item to play it directly  

CineChase works similarly to a web browser or local media player — it plays media from locations specified by the user.
